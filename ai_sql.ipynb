    "# Medi-Cal Enrollment AI Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis of Medi-Cal enrollment data, we leveraged a suite of Snowflake AI SQL features to rapidly transform raw monthly enrollment figures into clear, actionable insights. We began by aggregating enrollment counts by eligibility group over a six-month window and computing the percentage change for each group. To classify each trend as “Increasing,” “Stable,” or “Decreasing,” we used the AI_CLASSIFY function, which applies a lightweight model to label patterns in the data for easy interpretation. Next, we enriched our output with natural-language summaries generated by AI_COMPLETE (using the Claude-3-7-sonnet model) driven by carefully crafted PROMPT templates, providing plain-English explanations of each group’s trajectory. Although not shown here, similar patterns could be extended with AI_AGG and AI_SUMMARIZE for more advanced aggregation or narrative generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualization, we turned our classified and summarized results into a horizontal diverging bar chart using Altair: positive percentage changes are shaded in blue, negative in gray, and the bars are sorted to emphasize the most dramatic shifts. The chart’s dynamic title reflects the analysis date range, and its clean, professional styling makes it easy for stakeholders to spot which eligibility groups are growing or shrinking at a glance. By combining AI-driven classification, summarization, and traditional SQL aggregations with intuitive visual encoding, this pipeline delivers a comprehensive, end-to-end view of enrollment trends."

    "   - Records the first and last reporting dates (`RP_FIRST`, `RP_LAST`).\n",

    "2. **Trend Classification**  \n",

    "     - **Increasing** – enrollee counts are rising  \n",
    "     - **Stable**     – enrollee counts show little or no change  \n",
    "     - **Decreasing** – enrollee counts are falling  \n",
    "   - Applies a **PROMPT** template to the `ENROLLEE_COUNTS` string and returns the most appropriate trend label for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Natural-Language Summary**  \n",
    "   - Uses **AI_COMPLETE** (model `claude-3-7-sonnet`) with a **PROMPT** to generate a single plain-English summary per group.  \n",
